The hardest part 2 I encountered in the entire exercise.

There was a edge I missed. Went to reddit, and found 2 samples (`reddit.txt` and `reddit_2.txt`). My movement was great and already solved the first one, but the 2nd one introduced me to an edge case I didn't anticipate, that is moving multiple boxes, but one of those boxes was being obstructed. The initial solution would move the unobstructed boxes. However, it's either all boxes move, or no boxes move, because any obstruction will propogate back to the first box, and if the first box doesn't move, nothing moves!
